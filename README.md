# 1. Lead Scoring Case study
A logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.

# 2. Telecom Churn Case Study
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

The dataset contains customer-level information for a span of four consecutive months - June, July, August and September. The months are encoded as 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively.

Customers usually do not decide to switch to another competitor instantly, but rather over a period of time (this is especially applicable to high-value customers). In churn prediction, we assume that there are three phases of customer lifecycle :

Good Phase (6 & 7th month)
Action Phase (8th month)
Churn Phase (9th month)
The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months.
